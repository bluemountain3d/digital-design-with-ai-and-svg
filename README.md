# Individual Assignment: Digital Design with AI and SVG

This project was completed for the course "Graphical Tools for Interface Design" where I explored the applications of AI-generated imagery and interactive SVG elements. The assignment focused on understanding file formats and solving problems related to front-end development.

## SVG animation (GSAP)

### Description

From empty nothingness, the text "animate" takes shape and slowly emerges, growing from a modest size while fading in to its full glory. During this emergence, the letter "m" suddenly begins to elastically deflate. The playful letter "i" beside it awakens and with a cocky motion nudges the "m", which reacts by tilting, and distorting. While "m" struggles to regain balance, "i" performs an elegant, dizzying 360-degree pirouette, like an acrobat in a typographic circus act. While "i" peformes it's dramatic dance, "m" bounces back to its original form with a soft, springy motion. Just as the letter M lands, as a finale to this visual choreography, the tagline "BRING CODE TO LIFE" reveals â€“ a perfect conclusion that reinforces the message of bringing digital to life.

### Implementation details:

- [View HTML structure](./index.html)
- [View JavaScript animation code](./src/js/main.js)

#### Key techniques used:

- Timeline sequencing
- Custom easing functions
- Transform origin manipulation
- Letter-by-letter animation

## AI generated placeholder image

I used microsoft designer do generate this using following promps:<br>
"A simple generic nature theme greyscale placeholder image for webdevelopment".

The image was converted to webp and avif using ImageMagick command-line tool.

The idea is to use it as a good looking placeholder image for a nature & landscape photography website.
